Hey there!

This is my first ever project outside courses. It is using React.js in the frontend and Node.js and MongoDB in the backend as well as GraphQL.

There's still some work to do however, but I still chose to publish this site as it's almost done and showcases my skills.

You can find the site running at ballofroots.com.

TO-DO:
  save the cart to the local storage
  notification on adding plants to the cart
  add responsiveness to smaller screens and tablets
  find out why the cart animation works only for bigger screens
  delete some ugly plants like the micans and improve plant pictures
